### Master's project code

The code listed in this project is that developed for my masters project. 

The topic deals with the use of probabilistic matrix completion (PMF) for which fully Bayesian models were developed.
The project uses python and stan as the preffered programming languages, with the stan wrapper cmstanpy used to
call stan from within python.

The code was constructed for the specific implementation of using experimental excess enthalpy data transforming
into matrices and inferring the unknown entries using PMF
