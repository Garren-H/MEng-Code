### Master's project code

The code listed in this project is that developed for my masters project. 

The topic deals with the use of probabilistic matrix completion for which fully Bayesian models were developed.
The project uses python and stan as the preffered programming languages, with the stan wrapper cmstanpy used to
call stan from within python.
