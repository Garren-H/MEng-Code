This branch deals with the usage of the NRTL model for the prediction of the 
excesss enthalpy data. The method uses PMF to decompose the matrices of interaction
parameters into lower rank approximations. Several variants of the probabilistic model
was set up incorporating different prior information. These are listed under stan models.

Inference is hence made on the interactions parameters of the NRTL model which in turn 
describes the excess enthalpy.
